## More options

### Exclude files

Your project probably contains some content files that you don't want your users to search. Pass an array of paths (or regex) to the files you donâ€™t want to be indexed to dismiss them:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-algolia-index"
    [plugins.inputs]
      exclude = ['''^\/admin.*''', '''^\/search.*''', '/404.html']
```

### Exclude Everything BUT Blog Posts

Advanced Regex Alert! This will exclude all files that DON'T match the regex for URLs like `/blog/(year)/(month)/(day)/(slug)/index.html`.

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-algolia-index"
    [plugins.inputs]
      exclude = ['''^\/(?!blog\/[0-9]{4}\/[0-9]{2}\/[0-9]{2}\/(?!index.html)).*''']
```
